    You can also use cosmid coordinates:

    or GenBank coordinates
    http://www.wormbase.org/db/seq/gbrowse?source=wormbase;name=Z49126:-1000..1000
    
    The last example shows that you can use negative coordinates.  However, 
    coordinates are relative to base 1 of the sequence.
    
    4) open the best page on a region of the genetic map
    http://www.wormbase.org/db/misc/epic?name=unc-9;class=Locus
