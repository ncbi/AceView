/************** Stack package **************/

/*
* Stack really implements three different major features in the same package.
*
* The first feature is a conventional stack.   If you only use push()
* and pop() to manipulate the stack, it behaves as you might expect.
* The caveat is that when you pop a value, you must know what it
* is going to be.  The pop() macro just picks up the right number
* of bytes and hands them to you.
* 
* The second feature is a dynamically sized string.  One of the
* special data types used by the stack is "Text".  In the interface,
* this looks like a C string, but the actual content of the string
* is copied into the stack.
*
* This would be just like any other data item except for one thing:
* If the thing on the top of the stack is a Text, you can concatenate
* additional text onto it.  That is, after
* 	pushText(s,"a");
* 	catText(s,"b");
* 	catText(s,"c");
* 	cp = popText(s)
* 	assert( strcmp(cp,"abc") == 0 )
* 
* In fact, I see this feature used far more often that I ever see
* stack-like functions.
*
* If you use "Text" in the stack, do not also use other types of
* values.
*
* The third feature is a cursor.  You can set the cursor to an
* arbitrary position in the stack, and then you can peek at what
* is there.  You can also walk the cursor toward the top of the
* stack, so you can examine the stack content in the order it was
* pushed.
*
*
* Another common use of the stack is as a place to store strings
* without explicitly writing many malloc calls.
*	n = stackMark(s);
*	pushText(s,"xyzzy");
*	// do something
*	printf("%s\n",stackText(s,n));
*
*
* Creating a Stack:
*	s = stackCreate( initial size in bytes )
*		makes an empty stack
*
*	s = stackHandleCreate( initial size in bytes, handle )
*		makes an empty stack on a handle
*
*	s = stackReCreate( stack, initial size in bytes )
*		The existing stack is emptied.  If the memory allocated to
*		the stack is more than 500k, the data area will be freed
*		and re-created.
*
*	s = stackCopy( stack )
*		make another stack just like one that you have
*
* TextOnly stacks:
*
*	stackTextOnly( stack )
*		Sets a flag in the stack that alters the way various 
*		functions work.  If you use pushText(), catText(),
*		or catBinary(), you MUST set stackTextOnly.  (The
*		library does not enforce this restriction.)
*
*
* Destroying stacks:
*	stackDestroy( stack )
*
* Misc functions:
*	stackExtend( stack, size in bytes )
*		makes the stack bigger if necessary.  Since the stack
*		grows automatically, you don't really need this, but 
*		if you know you have a lot of data coming in, you can
*		grow it all at once.
*
*	stackClear( stack )
*		Makes the stack empty.  This is just like stackReCreate,
*		except it will not free memory.
*
*	stackEmpty( stack )
*		returns true if the stack contains 0 bytes of data
*
*	stackExists( stack )
*		returns true if the stack passed in appears to be
*		correctly initialized (i.e. has been created and
*		not destroyed)
*
* Stack functions that implement an actual stack:
*	push( stack, value, type )
*		push a value onto the top of the stack.  this is a macro.
*
*	pop(stack, type)
*		pops a value from the stack and returns it.  this is a macro.
*
*	push and pop really compute a pointer and then use *(type)pointer to
*	access the stack data.  That means you cannot push or pop any data
*	item that cannot be aligned on STACK_ALIGNMENT on the local processor.
*
*	It appears that on at least one machine supported by acedb, the
*	stack alignment used is not suitable for storing doubles.  I guess
*	it is either something about the Alpha or trying to keep doubles
*	aligned on the Pentium external data bus to avoid making two bus
*	transactions.  So, there are:
*
*	pushDouble( stack, double )
*	popDouble( stack )
*		just like push/pop, but with double values and alignments
*
* Text functions:
*	pushText( stack, char * )
*		copy the actual bytes of the string, including the \0 at
*		the end, onto the top of the stack.  You should only
*		use this with TextOnly stacks.
*
*	popText( stack )
*		pops a Text from the stack; returns char *.  The pointer
*		returned actually points into the stack memory.  The contents
*		become invalid when you next alter the stack in any way.
*		You should only use this with TextOnly stacks.
*
*	catText( stack, char *)
*		appends bytes to a Text that is already on top of the stack.
*			pushText(s, "abcd");
*			catText(s, "efgh");
*			cp = poptext(s);
*			assert( strcmp(cp,"abcdefgh") == 0);
*		This function should work fine on an empty stack, though
*		the code often says
*			pushText(s,"");
*		before using catText()
*
*		This function pops \0 bytes off the stack before appending
*		the data.  It keeps going until it finds something that
*		is not \0 and then appends there.  This means that you
*		should never use catText after a catBinary that may contain
*		\0 at the end of the data.  For example, in this code the 
*		data inserted by catBinary is eliminated completely:
*			pushText(s,"a");
*			catBinary(s,"\0\0",2);
*			catText(s,"b");
*
*	catBinary (Stack s, char* data, mysize_t size) ;
*		This is just like catText, except that it takes a size for
*		the string to be inserted so the string can contain \0.
*
*		catBinary is only useable with TextOnly stacks.
*
*		To extract your data from a TextOnly stack that has been
*		manipulated with catBinary, use this code:
*			mysize_t n = stackMark(s);
*			char *s = stackText(s, 0);
*			n = n - 1;
*			memcpy(my_buffer, s, n);
*
*	stackTokeniseTextOn( stack, string, delimiters )
*		The string you pass in is split into words at characters found
*		in the string delimiters.  The resulting words are pushed on
*		the stack in the order they exist in the string.  Multiple 
*		delimiters are allowed between words.  That is, "a\t\tb" 
*		tokenizes into two words, "a", "b", not "a", "", "b".
*
*		The delimiters in the string passed in are written over 
*		with \0.
*
*		The expectation is that you would use something like this to
*		extract words from the resulting stack:
*			stackCursor(s, 0);
*			while ((cp = stackNextText(s)))
*				printf("->%s<-\n",cp);
*
* Cursor for peeking into the stack:
*	There is one cursor in each stack.  It can be set to an arbitrary
*	position in the stack, and then moved toward the top of the stack
*	as you examine data in the stack.  None of these functions modify
*	the data in the stack.
*
*	stackMark( stack )
*		Returns an int that describes the current position of the top
*		of the stack.  You can pass this value to stackCursor later.
*
*	stackPos( stack )
*		returns an int that describes the current position of the
*		cursor in the stack.  You can pass this value to stackCursor 
*		later.
*
*	stackCursor( stack, position )
*		set the cursor to a particular position in the stack.  The
*		only values you can really trust are those returned from
*		stackMark() or stackPos(), or 0 which is the bottom of
*		the stack.
*
*	stackAtEnd( stack )
*		returns true if the cursor has reached the top of the
*		stack.
*
*	stackSkip( stack)
*	stackNext( stack, type )
*	stackNextText( stack )
*	stackDoubleNext( stack )
*		returns the data item at the current cursor position 
*		and moves the cursor up to the next data item.
*
*	stackText( stack, position )
*		returns the text at the indicated position in the stack.
*		This does not modify the cursor.
*
*	stackTextForceFeed( stack , size )
*		NOTE: This is an older function.  A better way to do 
*		the same thing is:
*			s = stackReCreate(s, length);
*			catBinary(s, answer, length );
*		
*		Grow the stack to the indicated size, and make it look like that
*		much data has been place in the stack.  This function does NOT
*		put any data in the stack -- it just moves all the pointers
*		around.  You can see it used like this:
*			s = stackReCreate (s,length) ;
*			stackTextForceFeed (s, length) ;
*			memcpy (stackText(s,0), answer, length) ;
*		That is, the code knows how Stack is implemented and is directly
*		manipulating the stack internals.
