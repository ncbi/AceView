<h2>Query_By_Example</h2>

Query By Example is the simplest query interface available in
ACEDB. See help for the <A HREF="Query_Builder.html">Query
Builder</a>, the <A HREF="Query.html">Query Commands window</a>, and
the <A HREF="Table_Maker.html">TableMaker</a> to learn more about
other search tools. Help is also available for the <A
HREF="Query_syntax.html"> query language</a> itself but you can use
Query By Example without understanding it.<p>

Based upon a fill-in-the-blank and toggle-button style of entry, Query
By Example allows the user to fill in values in a class model-display.
These values are then used in a conjunctive query command to retrieve
data objects from the database.<p>

This window can be used in conjunction with or independently of the <A
HREF="Query.html">Query Commands window</a>. Query results appear in a
<A HREF="KeySet.html">KeySet window</a>.<p>

to execute a query formed in this window, use the <strong>Search
Locally</strong> button.

<h3>Buttons (above horizontal line)</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Quit</strong>: Exits the window.

<li><strong>Help</strong>: Invokes this section of the help file.

<li><strong>Clear</strong>: Clears the entry boxes and redraws the
window from scratch.

<li><strong>New KeySet</strong>: Calls up a new, blank keyset window.

<li><strong>Command Edit</strong>: Call up the Query Commands window.

<li><strong>Search Locally</strong>: Execute the current query and put
the found and selected objects in the Key Set.

<li><strong>Undo</strong>: Cancels the last command and redisplays the
previous Keyset (selection list).

</ul>

<h3>Boxes and Controls (above horizontal line)</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>"From" Selector</strong>: Actually a menu (activate by
right mouse button), this allows the user to use the current keyset as
the base for a query or to use the current class shown.  Simple
clicking of the left mouse button will "step" through the menu
selections.

<li><strong>"Class" Selector</strong>: Actually a menu (activate by
right mouse button), this allows the class being currently shown to be
changed to any class in the database.  Simple clicking of the left
mouse button will "step" through the menu selections. As your do so
the items below the horizontal line will change, reflecting the
structure of each class you visit.

<li><strong>ITEM NAME</strong>: This is a text entru box which can be
filled in to query for particular names of items within the current
class.

</ul>

<h3>Menu items:</h3>

In addition the the above functions, the Menu has the following
options:<p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Print</strong>: prepares a Post Script file in
./PS which you can then print on your local laser printer
(specified by ACEDB_LPR).

<li><strong>Refresh</strong>: Redraws the window.

<li><strong>Query Builder</strong>: Same as the Builder Button.  Call
up the Query Builder window.

<li><strong>Query Command Edit</strong>: Same as Command Edit Button.
Call up the Query Commands window.

<li><strong>AND, OR </strong>: The various tags and fields are
connected via the conjunctions AND (&amp;) and OR (|) as selected on
the menu.  Use the Query Builder window to view the composed query
command.

<li><strong>Show Full Description</strong>: Calls up the metadata
associated with the last picked (left mouse button) label or entry-box
on the display.

<li><strong>Show Long Description</strong>: Calls up the ?LongText
metadata associated with the last picked (left mouse button) label or
entry-box on the display.

<li><strong>Search Locally</strong>: Same as Search Locally Button.
Execute the current query and put the found and selected objects in
the Keyset (selection list).

<li><strong>Undo Search</strong>: Same as Undo Button: Cancels the
last command and redisplays the previous Keyset (selection list).

</ul>


<h3>Below the Horizontal Line</h3>

What you see below the horizontal line depends on which class you are
querying. All the tags and fields in a class will be represented.<p>

<strong>Fields</strong> are represented by the green text entry boxes.
Activate an entry box by picking it (click with the left mouse
button).  It turns yellow (dark grey on monochrome) and all
keyboard-input will then enter into that box. Simply pick and edit a
box for it to be folded into the current query command.
Sub-conditions, such as "&lt; 100.1", "&gt; fred", and "!= gene21" are
allowed in these lines.  For the numeric entries, the user will
receive a warning that the syntax is not numeric, which can be ignored
at the user's choice.<p>

When you press carriage-return (CR), the entry is processed for
correctness and, if the <A HREF="Query.html">Query Commands window</a>
is up, you will see a formed query on the current query command
line.<p>

Click the Search Locally button to search. Each time you click here
you will execute whatever query you have built.<p>

<strong>Tags</strong> are the labels adjacent to the fields. You can
search for the presence of a tag (rather than the contents of its
field) in a boolean exists/does_not_exist fashion. Clicking once on
the tag specifies it must be present. It will be highlighted. Clicking
again deselects the tag.<p>

<h3>Other Information</h3>

<strong>Scope</strong>: The query commands will modify the active
Keyset (selection list).  To select another key set, pick it once or
use the New KeySet command.<p>

<strong>Query Commands Display</strong>: If the Query Commands window
is open, the syntax formed by the Query-By-Example window will be
shown on a command edit line there.<p>

<strong>Note to curators</strong>: If you Read Models and update the
models, you may have to restart the ACEDB program for the correct QBE
display to appear.<p>
