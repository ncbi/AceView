<h2>Feature-map</h2>

[see also Help for <A HREF="DNA_analysis.html">DNA Analysis
window</a>]<p>

<strong><b>The cDNA  Acembly package has been substantially optimized for assembling cDNA on the genomic sequence with intron/exon behavior. see<a href="cDNA_Gene_map.html">Bly for cDNA</a></b></strong>
<p>

This display represents the the sequence.  You can pick most
things.<p>



<h3>Display Control Button</h3>

This gives access to a menu of display options.  All the options can
be toggled by picking on them.  e.g. select "DNA Sequence" to see the
DNA. Note that, to see the DNA, you should zoom in quite a lot.
Otherwise the bits of sequence ends with ... on each line.<p>

<h3>Menu items:</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Quit</strong>: quits the window.

<li><strong>Help</strong>: brings up this help.

<li><strong>Print Screen</strong>: prepares a Post Script file in
./PS which you can then print on your local laser printer.

<li><strong>Print Screen</strong>:

<li><strong>Preserve</strong>: insure that the next gmap will be
displayed in a different window, otherwise the present one will be
reused.

    
<li><strong>Recalculate</strong>:
    
<li><strong>Hide Header</strong>: Hides the buttons etc, useful before
printing. The pop up menu remains available to toggle back.


<li><strong>Export Sequence</strong>: Export the active DNA zone in
fasta format.


<li><strong>Export features</strong>: Export the translation of the
active gene as an Ascii file in Fasta format

<li><strong>Export translations</strong>: Export the translation of
all the genes of the active map in a single file in Fasta format





<li><strong>Analysis window</strong>: opens a new window called <A
HREF="DNA_analysis.html">DNA Analysis</a> with its own help entry.

</ul>

<h3>Top Line</h3>

The last sequence you touched is the Selected fMap, this shows in red
in the top left corner. This is the sequence used by dna analysis and
gels. You can have several sequence on the screen if you use the
Preserve option in the menu.<p>

<h3>Zooming</h3>

The Zooming works as in the genetic map. It is controlled by the 3
buttons, whole (for when you are lost!), zoom in, zoom out, and the
middle mouse button: to recentre slowly if the mouse is right of the
scale bar, or recenter fast and zoom continuously by dragging the mid
button starting left of the scale bar.<p>


<h3>Active-Zone and Origin</h3>

You can reset the origin by picking the origin value box, typing a
number and RETURN. Alternatively, pick the Origin button then a
gene.<p>

The active zone, indicated in the same coordinate system limits the
scope of the Anaylsis window, Genefinder, Fasta Dumps etc.  It then
shows as blue Shutter on the left side of the yellow bar.<p>

<h3>Clear</h3>

Clears the colourings, genefinder selections etc.<p>

<h3>Reverse-Complement</h3>

Pick it with the left button to reverse complement the sequence.  But
if you press the right mouse button, you get a sub-menu that lets you
independently complement or reverse the sequence. This may be useful
to compare the features of both strands. On the top right corner of
the window, the staus REVERSED or COMPLEMENT is recalled.<p>


Introns-exons are shown as rectangular boxes (the exons) connected by
springs, the introns. The one on the right go downwards, the one on
the left of the scale go upwards, i.e. they belong to the other
strand. They correspond to the negative reading frames of the analysis
menu.<p>

Picking the subsequences move you to their text value.<p>

Picking the clone box which may occur at the top will move you to
the physical map.<p>

In the case of cDna you will get a text hybridize to Yacs...,
picking one of these yacs will put you on the physical map.<p>
<h3>Genefinder</h3>

Much of the functionality of Phil Green's genefinder package is built
into ACEDB.  A reference is given when you first use the package.  To
access genefinder functions, use the right mouse button on the
indicated box to get at the submenu.  You must get "Genefinder
features" first.  Then "Autofind Gene" will act in the current active
zone.  It will attempt to find the best predicted gene including all
features currently selected (indicated in LIGHTGREEN).  If you have
write access it will create a working gene model, called "Temp_gene".
Selected features can be hand-edited by using the submenu attached to
each feature.  "Fix temp_gene" allows you to make temp_gene into a
permanently stored gene prediction.  "Gene -&gt; selected" allows you
to set the selected features from a previously determined gene.
"Selected -&gt; temp_gene" lets you convert the currently selected
features into a gene structure.  One common cause of problems is that
some features are selected somewhere else in the sequence (perhaps the
other strand!) -- use the "Clear" button to reset everything.<p>

Genefinder uses tables of codons frequencies etc which are part of the
acedb distribution in the wgf subdirectory. The environment variable
GF_TABLES will overide the $ACEDB/wgf default and let you use your own
tables.<p>
