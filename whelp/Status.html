<h2>Status</h2>

Available from <A HREF="acedb.html">Main Window</a> pop-up
menu. Displays information about disk and memory useage and also
software and data version.<p>

The first line contains the software version number and the data
release number. The data release number changes each time the database
curator distributes a new official update file.<p>

The next line indicates explicitly the session number. This number is
changed whenever new data are entered and saved. Also shown is the
login name of the user and the current write access state.<p>

The <strong>On disk</strong> line concerns the file
database/blocks.wrm It indicates the number of blocks really used by
the database, followed by the number of blocks still available.  You
may want to monitor these figures from time to time. The number of
used blocks should grow substantially only when you parse a lot of new
data or when you multiply the number of different sessions kept
available. It should decrease when you destroy old sessions.  If at
some point blocks.wrm becomes full, the program will ask permission to
extend it as needed. If you refuse, the current session will be lost
and you will simply restart on the statu quo ante.<p>

The number of lexiques corresponds to the number of different
classes as defined in wspec/classes.wrm. The number of keys
is the number of independent objects known to the database. The
number of char is the cumulated length of their names and of
the entries in class Text.<p>

The number of nodes and arrays gives an indication on the
usage of the memory. They may be useful to debug a new piece of
code and check, for example that all the arrays created for a given
purpose get destroyed when they should.<p>

You should have <p>

<pre>
	used objects = locked + known
</pre>

with locked dropping to zero after a clean up.<p>

The number of modified objects should drop to 0 after a Save (<A
HREF="acedb.html">Main Window</a> pop-up menu).

Stream level should drop to 1, unless you are in the process of
reading data.</a>
