<EM>Help pager written by Martin Aslett, August '97</EM>

<P>BioMotif is an external program, written by <A
href="http://www.lpm.univ-montp2.fr/~menes/menes.html">Gerard Mennessier</A>, which
can be called from within xace. Its aim is to help the user find
Motifs within sets of sequences.

<P> BioMotif is fully documented at <A
href="http://www.lpm.univ-montp2.fr/~menes/bioMotif_html_doc/bioMotif_index.html">http://www.lpm.univ-montp2.fr/~menes/bioMotif_html_doc/bioMotif_index.html</A>.<P>

In order to run bioMotif within ACeDB, the software must be fully
installed on your machine (it does not come packaged with the standard
ACeDB release). The software may be downloaded from :-<P>

<A href="ftp://ftp.lpm.univ-montp2.fr/pub/BioMotif/">ftp://ftp.lpm.univ-montp2.fr/pub/BioMotif/</A>
<P>

This directory contains a README file giving full instructions on how
to install the BioMotif software on your machine.

Before running BioMotif from within xace, the environment variable
BIOMOTIF_DIR should be set to the directory above bioMotif_bin (which
contains the BioMotif executable) i.e. the executable file will be
found at:- <P>

<B>BIOMOTIF_DIR/bioMotif_bin/bioMotif</B>
<P>

BioMotif may be run in xace from the FMAP display, under the
'Analysis' button, either by activating it via the pulldown menu
accessible from the button or by clicking the 'Analysis' button and
choosing BioMotif from the list of External Analysis Programs. The DNA
Analysis window may also be opened directly from the pull down menu of
main class window of ACeDB<P>


Once BioMotif is run, the following parameters window is called up :-<P>

A query should be typed into the yellow box. Consult the <A
href="http://www.lpm.univ-montp2.fr/~menes/bioMotif_html_doc/bioMotif_index.html">documentation</A>
for details of the query syntax.<P>

One of the three target buttons should be clicked before BioMotif can be run :-
<P>

<B>Active Zone</B> - uses the active zone on the current sequence display as the target for your BioMotif query.</BR>
<B>Active Keyset</B> - uses any sequences in the current keyset as the target.
<B>Whole database</B> - uses all of the sequences in the database as the target.
<P>

Clicking one of these will cause a 'Search' button to appear in the
bottom left hand corner of the window. Clicking this button runs
BioMotif. If BIOMOTIF_DIR is set wrongly or the BioMotif software is
not installed, an error window will appear informing you that ACeDB
couldn't find the software.  <P>

If the software runs successfully, BioMotif will report it's results
in the parameters window, giving details of the sequences conforming
to your search parameters together with details of the base pairs in
the sequence which match the search. It will also open a new window
titled 'Motifs' containing the same details and a keyset window
containing all of the sequences on which the search was successful.
