<h2>Tag Chooser</h2>

The tag chooser appears in several contexts: after invoking <A
HREF="Attach.html">Attach</a> in a <A HREF="Tree.html">text
window</a>, constructing a table in the <A
HREF="Table_Maker.html">TableMaker</a>, and defining a query in the <A
HREF="Query_Builder.html">Query Builder</a>.  The purpose in each case
is to display the structure of a class and allow you to select some
part of it.<p>

The layout of the tag-chooser closely resembles that in a text window
with an important difference: the tag chooser shows all the
<var>potential</var> tags and fields an object can have, not just the
ones that have been used. By default ACEDB hides unused tags and
fields when it displays an object; this allows objects to be
arbitrarily complex yet keeps the display compact.<p>

Note that the tag chooser is a blocking window. You must either pick
an element or CANCEL/QUIT in order to continue using ACEDB.<p>

<h3>Menu items</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Cancel</strong>: cancels operation and dismisses
the tag chooser window.
<li><strong>Help</strong>: brings up this help.
<li><strong>Print</strong>: prepares a Post Script file in
./PS which you can then print on your local laser printer.
</ul>

<h3>Buttons</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Attach...</strong>: this button doesn't do anything
in the context of a tag chooser window.

<li><strong>Quit</strong>: cancels operation and closes the
tag-chooser.

<li><strong>Tables...</strong>: shows only if tables are
defined in wspec/table.menu.wrm for this class.

<li><strong>Cancel</strong>: same as quit.

<li><strong>Help</strong>: brings up this help.

<li><strong>Print</strong>: prepares a Post Script file in
./PS which you can then print on your local laser printer.

</ul>

<h3>Using the tag chooser</h3>

Any tag or field highlighted in color in the tag chooser window can be
picked. The first click selects the element and the second click
actually picks it with respect to Attach, the TableMaker, or the Query
Builder. If an element is shown in green (a "subtype") it can be
double-clicked to reveal additional tags and fields.<p>

Picking an element will close the tag chooser.<p>

There are 3 kinds of elements to choose from in the tag chooser: tags,
objects, or values. See the help for <A HREF="Attach.html">Attach</a>,
the <A HREF="Query_Builder.html">Query Builder</a>, and the <A
HREF="Table_Maker.html">TableMaker</a> for information about how these
tools interpret the choice you make in the tag chooser window.<p>
