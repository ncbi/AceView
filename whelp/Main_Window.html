**Main_Window

  For general information about the program, how to get on line
help, how to use the mouse, how to print windows, authorship,
distribution, copyright etc, press the page_up button.

 ** To exit the program choose Quit from the menu in the main window. **

The main window lets you find objects in the database in two
different ways:

(1) You can pick a class by clicking with the left mouse button.
Clicking again will give a list of all objects in that class in the
Selection Window.  You can restrict this list by typing a template
in the Template box.  When you press the Return key you activate the
search.  Name recognition is not case sensitive.  A '*' in the
template will match anything; e.g. "S*" will match all names
beginning with 'S', "*S*" will match all names containing an 'S',
"*a*b" all names containing an 'A' and ending with a 'B'.  To
actually display the object you must pick its names twice in the
Selection Window (see help for Selection Window).

(2) You can type a text string in the Text Search box (first click
on it with the left button to make it yellow).  This will find all
the objects in the database which contain the search text.  More
precisely, we find all objects whose name contains the search
string, all objects they refer to, and all containing Text (or other
X class data) containing the search string.

In addition the Main Window menu allows access to many other
applications and functions of acedb.
