<h2>Make_maps (Align)</h2>

The idea is to establish a correspondance between the genetic map and
the physical map. This is used later to jump between maps by
continuous interpolation between the cloned genes. This function
should be run whenever the genetic map, the clone map or the amount of
known sequences have changed appreciably.<p>
