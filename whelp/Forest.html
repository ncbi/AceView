<h1>Forest display</h1>

<p>
The Forest display is invoked from a keyset via the "More Info"
button. The display shows the contents of the keyset (excluding empty
objects) as a list of objects in their "tree" form (similar to text
windows). The Forest controls can be used to choose which parts of the
object are actually visible, i.e. which branches of the model to show
or hide. This display does not behave well with keysets containing items
from different classes.
</p>

<h2>Buttons:</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Quit: <dd>quits the display

<dt>Help: <dd>invokes on-line help (not yet written)

<dt>Print: <dd>invokes the Print/Mail selection tool which allows printing,
mailing or saving the forest document as a file.

<dt>Discard/Undiscard: <dd>The discard button to the right of each object when
clicked will remove that object from the display. Undiscard will
sequentially restore the objects, with the most recently removed being
restored first. A running commentary below the buttons details total
number of displayable objects, the number currently displayed, and the
number discarded.

<dt>Export: <dd>Creates keyset containing objects currently
displayed. Discarded objects are not exported. The user is asked to
name the new keyset via a "please reply" box.

<dt>Save as: <dd>Saves currently displayed objects as named keyset.

<dt>Biblio: <dd>Invokes the biblio display if the objects in the Forest
display qucontain references to Paper objects. If there are no
references to paper objects, the operation aborts with a dialog box.

<dt>Model show/hide: <dd>Inserts/removes model at top of window. All tags will
be green initially (see below). 

<dt>Tags hide: <dd>Hides all tags in the individual objects. Colours the tags
in the model red. (see below).

<dt>Tags show: <dd>Returns the information associated with the tags to the
display. Recolours the tags in the model green (see below).

<p>
When the model is shown, it only contains the tags being used by the
currently displayed objects which are actually visible in the window.
To see the complete model, double-click the boldface "Model". The
individual tags can be selected by the user and have three
states. Green indicates that the tag and any information following it
is visible. Yellow indicates that the tag has been collapsed. Red
indicates that the tag is hidden. Repeated clicks will cycle through
the three states. The "Tags hide" button will hide all tags regardless
of their state. "Tags show" will show all tags and reset them to
green.
</p>
<p>
The behaviour of the Forest display depends on exactly which objects
are visible within the borders of the window. For example, when using
the "Tags hide" button, objects in effect take up less screen space.
Consequently, objects which had been outside the boundary of the
display may now move into the visible area. These new objects may have
additional (new) tags associated with them.  These tags will be
visible in the objects and will be added to the model and coloured
green. Clicking "tags hide" again will hide these new tags.  Other
events may also have this effect, for example as objects are discarded
or undiscarded, as the list is scrolled (see Scroll Bar), or as the
window is resized.
</p>

<dt>Select: <dd>en francais, does not seem to do anything.

<dt>Arrow controls: <dd>single arrow scrolls one object at a time (up or
down) two arrows scrolls a window-full [we think].

</dl>

<h2>Scroll Bar:</h2>

<p>
The green bar indicates which objects out of the entire keyset are in
view. Scroll with the middle button on the mouse by grabbing and
moving the green bar up or down.
</p>

<h2>Go to:</h2>
<p>
Scrolls to the first object that matches the string.
Ma would scroll to the first object starting with the letter Ma.

to the right red too.
bug--This display does not behave well with keysets containing items
from different classes.
