This is the AC library - a C interface to acedb
Authors: Mark Sienkiewicz, Jean Thierry-Mieg (2003)
--

There are two implementations here:  

acclient is a client library.  It is known to work with RPC servers
(e.g. gifacemblyserver) and AceTCP servers (tgifacemblyserver).  It has
code to support Sanger Acedb 4.9, but that support is incomplete.
[3/2003]

acinside provides the same interface, but it runs inside the database
(either in tace or a server) and takes advantage of direct access to
database functions to improve performance.  It is fully tested [11/2003]

If you limit yourself to using only AC calls, your code can run equally
correctly either inside or outside the database.

Note that you might expect acinside to always be significantly faster,
but in fact many applications use a pattern of transactions where the time
spent transmitting data between the client and server is dwarfed by the
time spent performing the actual query.


Compiling with AC
--

Your program should
	#include <wac/ac.h>

wac/acctest.c contains test code that exercizes the library.  It can also
serve as sample code for some of the features.

To compile your application as a client:

	in the AceDB makefile:
		include $(LINK_ACC) in your dependencies
		include $(LINK_ACC) in the list of object files to include

	outside the AceDB makefile
		get the value of LINK_ACC from wmake/truemake and link
		with those object files


To compile your application as a stand alone code:

	in the AceDB makefile:
		include $(LINK_ACS) in your dependencies
		include $(LINK_ACS) in the list of object files to include

	outside the AceDB makefile
		get the value of LINK_ACS from wmake/truemake and link
		with those object files


Compiling the actual library
--

You can compile the library by the command
make libaccl.a libacs.a
or, relying on dependencies, by compiling a program that uses it, e.g.
make accmd

The supported transport mechanisms are selected by defines in
wac/acclient_.h; you can add/remove transports as you wish.  The
dependencies are correct for this library, so it is sufficient to
change the include file and re-compile.


Test code
--

acctest is the "ac client test" program.  
acstest is the "ac autonamous test" program.  

0) add the executables in your file
   in csh the command would be
   set path = $path `pwd`/../bin.$ACEDB_MACHINE
1) initialize the database:

	pushd wac/testdb
	sh init
	popd 

2) test the autonomous ac code type

   bin*/acstest wac/testdb all | tee acstest.out

3) test the client ac code type
  a) Start a server
    
    bin*/taceserver wac/testdb -port 65432

  b) run the client code

    bin*/acctest a:localhost:65432:: all | tee acctest.out
	
4) verify the outputs, they may differ from the standard out put by dates and machine names

   diff  wac/testdb/acstest_correct_output acstest.out 
   diff  wac/testdb/acctest_correct_output acctest.out 

The last paramenter (here all) is a list of tests to run in order.  
Test "all" performs a test of much of the library, and the expected output is available.

If you change the test program or library, you must update that file.

5) clean up

   pushd wac/testdb ; sh ./clean_up ; popd

Protocols
--

The acedb@ncbi distribution includes 2 server protocols
    make aceserver gifacemblyserver   :: (r) rpc protocol
    make taceserver tgifacemblyserver :: (a) socket protocol

The acedb from www.acedb.org includes by default 
    make saceserver :: (s) sanger protocol

The AcePerl code knows the (r) and (s) protocols

The 'taceclient' knows all 3 protocols

Recommended config:
  To use only AceC: run the (a) tgifacemblyserver
  configure ther privacy in wpec/acetcp_access.wrm (autodocumented)
  connect using: my_acec_prog a:host:port

However
  To use both AceC and AcePerl: run an (r) rpc server
  configure ther privacy in wpec/server.log (autodocumented)
  allow the rpc protocol in wac/acclient_.h and recompile
  connect using: my_acec_prog r:host:port

To connect to the wormbase server of Lincoln Stein
  this saceserver uses the (s) sanger protocol
  connect using: my_acec_prog s:host:port



Files here
--

	Common code
	--

	ac.h
		common include file.  clients only need this file

	ac_.h
		internals common to both library implementations.  If you are
		adding something, chances are that it does not really belong
		here.

	actable_.h
	actable.c
		AC_TABLE section of the code - used in both libraries


	Client library
	--

	acclient_.h
	acclient.c
		the AC client code.

	acclient_acetcp.c
	acclient_rpc.c 
	acclient_socket.c
		Ace network protocol implementations.  all of these files are
		included in acclient.c, but each file is mostly ifdefed out
		if it's protocol is not wanted
                edit the file acclient_.h to add remove a protocol
                choose the lines LINK_ACC_RPC=$(RPC_CLIENT_OBJS)
                                 #LINK_ACC_RPC=
                in wmake/truemake to compile or not the RPC client library


	ace-conn-hacked.c
		code for acclient_socket.c to talk to the socket server - copied
		from Sanger's Ace-Conn and hacked extensively to work in our system.

	acctest.c
		a test program for testing the database client code.  uses the
		database in testdb

	accmd.c
		sends commands to the database using ac_command().  This is much
		like aceclient, and will replace aceclient eventually.


	Internal library

	acinside_.h
	acinside.c
		the AC inside-the-database implementation
