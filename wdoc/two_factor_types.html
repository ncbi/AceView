CLASSIFICATION OF TWO-FACTOR DATA 	Jonathan Hodgkin 21/4/93
=================================


   Phenotypes:  WT = wild type
                nonWT = viable non-wild-type,
                ALL = total viable progeny
                X = x/x and xy/x+, Y = y/y and xy/+y
                XY = xy/xy
                D = d/+ and d/d, dx/+ etc
                H = xy/x+

        Type            Phenotypes              Calculation

A.  Recessive markers x and y, segregation from xy/++ hermaphrodites

    1.  Full            WT X Y XY               (2p-p^2)/2 =
                                                (X+Y)/(WT+X+Y+XY)

    2.  One_recombinant WT X                    (2p-p^2)/3 =
                                                 X/(WT+X)

    3.  Selected           X   XY               (2p-p^2) = X/(X+XY)

    4.  One_all            X       ALL          (2p-p^2)/4 = X/ALL

    5.  Recs_all           X Y     ALL          (2p-p^2)/2 =
                                                (X+Y)/ALL

A'   Recessive markers x and y, segregation from xy+/++z, where z is
        tightly linked and z/z is lethal or otherwise not scored.

    6.  One_let            X       ALL          (2p-p^2)/2 = X/ALL

B    Recessive markers, segregation from x+/+y hermaphrodites

    7.  Tested             H             X       2p/(1+p) = H/X


    8.  Selected_trans     X    XY               p^2 = XY/(X+XY)


C    Recessive markers, scored by backcross: xy/++ males crossed with
        xy/xy hermaphrodites.  Usually only males scored.

    9.  Backcross       WT X Y XY                p = (X+Y)/(WT+X+Y+XY)

   10.  Back_one        WT X                     p = X/(WT+X)



D    Recessive sex-linked markers, x+/+y hermaphrodites crossed with wild
        males, male progeny scored.

   11.  Sex_all         WT X Y XY                p = (WT+XY)/(WT+X+Y+XY)

   12.  Sex_one         WT X                     p = WT/(WT+X)


D'   Recessive sex-linked markers, xy/++ hermaphrodites crossed with wild
        males, male progeny scored.

   13.  Sex_cis            X            ALL      p/2 = X/ALL


E    One marker (d) is dominant or semidominant.  Segregation from x+/+d
        hermaphrodites.  For dom_semi, D = d/+, not d/d (as in sqt)


   14.  Dom_one         WT      nonWT           (2p-p^2)/4 = WT/(WT+nonWT)

   15.  Dom_selected    WT X                    (2p-p^2) = WT/(WT+X)

   16.  Dom_semi                   XD   ALL     (p-p^2)/2 = XD/ALL


E'  One marker (d) is dominant, and either d or x is recessive lethal

   17.  Dom_let         WT              ALL     (2p-p^2)/3 = WT/ALL



F   Direct: single progeny picked and tested for genotype
        on both chromosomes

   18.  Direct          R = # recombinant chromosomes   p = R/T
                        T = # total chromosomes


G   Complex:

   19.  Complex_mixed      X            ALL             (2p-p^2)/5 =
