<H1>Application programmers' guide to the arraysubs package</H1>

<PRE>

The arraysubs package contains a number of widely used utility
packages.  The code is in arraysub.c.  The public interface is in
array.h.  The code relies on the messubs package for error handling
(messubs.c, regular.h).

Array package
-------------

This is pervasisve in ACEDB.  It gives arbitrary length extendable
arrays, called Arrays (with a capital initial 'A').  They are
accessed via macros for efficiency when you are sure that they are
not being extended.  Many other functions are in fact macros to
give a cleaner programmer's interface (see the header file array.h
for details).

Basic operations:
	Array arrayCreate (int n, TYPE)

n is the initial size.  TYPE is a legitimate type.  sizeof(TYPE) is
taken (in a macro) to determine what size objects to have in the
array. 

	Array arrayHandleCreate(int n, TYPE, STORE_HANDLE handle)

is analogous, but registers the resulting array to be destroyed by an call
to handleFree(). See messubs.doc for details.

	Array arrayReCreate (Array a, int n, TYPE)

If a exists already it is cleared and extended if necessary to
length n.  In this case the size of TYPE must correspond to the
previous type size (they ought to be the same type if you have any
sense!), else you messcrash().  If a does not exist then it is
created as with arrayCreate.  arrayReCreate() never deallocates
memory, so repeated recreation of a static work array is more
efficient than create/destruction.

	BOOL  arrayDestroy (Array a)

This is a macro that returns destroys a (releasing all its memory)
and returns TRUE if a is non-zero, and returns FALSE if a == 0.

	int arrayMax (Array a)

Returns the largest index addressed so far plus one.  i.e. the
number of elements.  A (very) common use is as an upper bound to a
loop, e.g.: 

	for (i = 0 ; i < arrayMax(a) ; ++i)
	  x += arr(a,i,float) ;

arrayMax() is a macro that can in principle be assigned to.
Unfortunately we do this quite a lot to clear arrays (e.g.
arrayMax(a) = 0).  This is considered very bad form.  If you want
to clear the array then call arrayRecreate().  Any other explicit
manipulation of arrayMax is completely beyond the pale!

	TYPE  array (Array a, int i, TYPE)
	TYPE* arrayp (Array a, int i, TYPE)
	TYPE  arr (Array a, int i, TYPE)
	TYPE* arrp (Array a, int i, TYPE)

These are the basic functions to access members of an Array.  They
can all be used as lvalues as well as rvalues, i.e. you can assign
to them.  arrayp() and arrp() give a pointer to the i'th element of
a, while array() and arr() give the element itself.  array() and
arrayp() make subroutine calls that check whether i >= arrayMax(a),
and if so extend the array if necessary and update arrayMax(a).
arr() and arrp() are pure macros that do not check arrayMax(a) and
should therefore only be used for accessing existing entries, not
for creating new ones that might go beyond the previous limits.

	int arrayExists (Array a)

This returns 0 if a is not an array, or a unique id if it is.  If
you really want to be sure that you have the same array now as some
other time you should keep the id, and check it against the new
value.  The reason for this is that sometimes an array is destroyed
and another created using the same memory, so there is a valid
Array with pointer value "a", even though the one that you thought
it was has been destroyed.  This can lead to VERY subtle bugs.  The
most watertight solution would have been to use unique integers as
the Array values; this was done for the Graph handle, but it has
too high an efficiency cost for the Array package.

	int arrayStatus (int *memAlloc, int *memUsed)

This returns the number of active arrays, and fills the arguments with
the total amount of memory allocated, and the total amount of memory
being used (i.e. the sum of the sizes of the memory blocks up to the
current maximal entry in each array), both in bytes.

	int arrayReportMark (void)
	void arrayReport (int j)

This allows more detailed monitoring.  arrayReportMark gives the
number of the most recently allocated array. arrayReport write out a
line to stderr on each array created since j (the result of a previous
call to arrayReportMark, or 0 for all arrays).

Minor Array routines:
  Array arrayCopy (Array a)	- gives a copy, including contents
  void  arrayExtend (Array a, int n)
			- extends a to length at least n.  Should
			  not be used - use array() or arrayp()

arrayForceFeed() is in array.h but considered too abusive by
Richard, who is writing this.

Sorted Array package
--------------------

A number of additional routines are very useful for maintaining
sorted arrays.  Many of them make use of an order() function passed
by the user, exactly as with Unix sort().  
	order(TYPE *x, TYPE *y)
  should return negative if x < y, 0 if x == y, positive if x > y.
All the equality matches in these functions are byte-wise matches.
 
void arraySort (Array a, int (*order)())
		- Sorts a in ascending order of order(). 
		  Uses qsort().  Does not remove duplicates.
BOOL arrayIsEntry (Array a, int i, void *s)
		- returns TRUE if arr(a,i,) matches *s, else FALSE
BOOL arrayFind (Array a, void *s, int *ip, int (*order)())
		- if *s matches any arr(a,i,) sets *ip = i and 
		  returns TRUE, else FALSE
BOOL arrayInsert (Array a, void * s, int (*order)())
		- s is a pointer to a potential entry.  
		  Returns FALSE if arrayFind (a, s, &junk, order)
		  else inserts *s in order.
BOOL arrayRemove (Array a, void * s, int (*order)())
		- if arrayFind (a, s, &junk, order) removes it and
		  returns TRUE, else returns FALSE
void arrayCompress (Array a)
		- removes bytewise duplicate entries - assumes
		  already sorted.

Stack package
-------------

This gives standard stack functions on an arbitrary-size stack.
There are also some extensions to handle arbitrary length text.  It
makes priveleged use of Arrays (i.e. uses internal non-documented
properties of their implementation).

Stacks can be used for pushing/popping.  They also hold a cursor
that can be used to step through the stack forwards.  They can hold
heterogeneous data types, since the package works in bytes.  This
is used in the graph package, and elsewhere.

Creation/Destruction:

	Stack stackCreate (int n)
	Stack stackHandleCreate(int n, STORE_HANDLE handle)
	Stack stackReCreate (Stack s, int n)

stackCreate() creates stack of n bytes initial size (n is just a
guideline - it can be exceeded without error).  stackReCreate()
behaves analagously to arrayReCreate().

	BOOL stackDestroy (Stack s)

analagous to arrayDestroy().

	BOOL stackExists (Stack s)

Unlike for the arrayExists() this is just a BOOL.  Oh well, I guess
we never had any problems with this one.

Basic operations:
	void push (Stack s, DATA x, TYPE)
	TYPE pop (Stack s, TYPE)
	BOOL stackEmpty (Stack s)

These are all complex macros, that may call functions if necessary
to extend the stack.  In push() x must be of type TYPE.  push()
only refers to x once, but they all refer to s many times, so avoid
side-effects in your instantiation of s. stackEmpty() is a macro that
can be used when popping to check if there is anything left on the
stack to pop.  It is a fatal error to pop off an empty stack.

For Efficiency Reasons, it is not permissable to push or pop
a type double. Instead use;

	void pushDouble(Stack s, double x)
        double popDouble(Stack s)

Text operations:
	void  pushText (Stack s, char *text)
	char* popText (Stack s)
	void  catText (Stack s, char *text)
 	char* stackText (Stack s, int mark)

pushText() pushes text onto a stack, and popText() takes it off.  They
correctly handle arbitrarily long text.  catText() must follow
pushText(), or another catText().  It concatenates the text like
strcat(), but you don't have to worry about buffer overflow.  The top
of the stack is always left on a word boundary, to avoid alignment
problems.  stackText() gives a way to access the text in a stack if
you do not want to destroy it using popText().  Normally mark is set
to 0, starting from the start of the stack, but it could also be a
return value from stackMark() (see below).  stackTextMax() gives the
byte length of text, assuming there is a single text object on the
stack. 

There is an additional function
	void catBinary (Stack s, char* data, int size)
analogous to catText that uses memcpy to add any type and amount of
data.

Functions to use the cursor:
	int    stackMark (Stack s)
	void   stackCursor (Stack s, int mark)
	TYPE   stackNext (Stack s, TYPE)
	double stackDoubleNext(Stack s)
	char*  stackNextText (Stack s) 
	BOOL   stackAtEnd (Stack s)

stackMark() returns a cursor value.  stackCursor() repositions the
cursor to a previously determined mark.  0 is a valid cursor value for
the start of the stack, i.e. it is valid to stackCursor (s, 0).
stackNext() delivers the item at the current cursor location and
increments the cursor.  stackDoubleNext is the equivalent for doubles, which
are not permissable with stackNext. stackNextText() delivers text put onto the
stack using pushText(), and moves the cursor to the next item past it.
stackAtEnd (Stack s) is a macro that returns TRUE if the cursor is at
the end of the stack.  It is a fatal error to go past the end of the
stack.

NB stackMark() gives the number of bytes from the base of the stack to
its current top, so can be used as a stackMax() call to give the
current size of the stack.

Tokeniser:
	void stackTokeniseTextOn (Stack s, char *text, char *delimiters)

This is potentially a nice tokeniser for text, but we don't use it
much and it probably needs more work.  Look at the code if you are
interested. 

Minor stack routines:
  void stackClear (Stack s)	- empties the stack
  void stackExtend (Stack s, int n) - see arrayExtend()

stackTextForceFeed() is an ugly unsanctioned call.
 
Associator package
------------------

This is a package that implements hash tables to allow arbitrary
pointers or integers to be associated with each other.  The
implementation keeps the hash table between 1/4 and 1/2 full.  The
hash function used is exceedingly simple:   
	hash = ((unsigned int)xin >> 2) & a->mask ;
The division by four (>> 2) is to make hashing pointers more
efficient, but it means that consecutive integers hash badly.  There
is no text hashing capability yet.

NB You can not associate anything to xin == 0.  This is used as the
marker for an empty bin.

The basic routines to create/destroy etc. mimic those for Array/Stack:
	Associator assCreate (void)
	Associator assBigCreate (int n)	-- lets you set the initial size
	Associator assReCreate (Associator a)
	BOOL       assDestroy (Associator a)
	BOOL	   assExists (Associator a)

The routines to add/find/subtract entries are:
	BOOL    assInsert (Associator a, void* xin, void* xout)
	void 	assMultipleInsert(Associator a, void* xin, void* xout)
	BOOL    assFind (Associator a, void* xin, void* *pout)
	BOOL    assRemove (Associator a, void* xin)
	BOOL	assPairRemove(Associator a, void *xin, void *xout)
	BOOL    assFindNext (Associator a, void *xin, void* *pout)

assInsert() fails if something has already been associated to xin.
assMultipleInsert allows more than one association with xin.
assPairRemove only removes an association with xin of it is to xout.
assFindNext is used to get multiple associations to the same key.
Start by calling assFind to initialise things, then call assfindNext until
it returns FALSE. Note that the first call to AssFindNext gives the same result
as the call to assFind.
The other calls are self-explanatory.

Utility routines are:
	void    assDump (Associator a)
	void    assClear (Associator a)
	BOOL    assNext (Associator a, void* *pin, void* *pout)

assDump() uses printf and is only for debugging.  assClear() empties
the associator.  assNext() allows you to step through all the entries.
Start with *pin == 0.  Each call that returns TRUE gives a new in/out
pair, until the end of the table is reached, when it returns FALSE.

You can read a->n, which is the number of stored items, but do not set
it!  This should be a function call.

Line breaking package
---------------------

This is a package to break lines.  Lines are broken at spaces if
possible, else at width exactly if there are no spaces.  Of course any
'\n's contained in the text are respected as line breaks.

There are several variants.  One possibility is to first call 
	int uLinesText (char *text, int width)
then successively one of 
	char *uNextLine (char *text)
	char *uPopLine (char *text)
which get the lines in forward or reverse order, ending with a 0.

Alternatively
	char **uBrokenLines (char *text, int width)
gives a zero terminated array of lines, while
	char *uBrokenText (char *text, int width)
gives a single string into which '\n's have been intercalated.
